      <description>Salary history Inspired by Jamie Tanna&amp;rsquo;s blogpost, I wanted to share my salary history.
I included part-time jobs I had as a student and all employers (and held titles) after graduation. In the future I&amp;rsquo;ll also create blogposts on what I do/have done in these positions. I mostly created this page to have another resource available for software engineers in the south of The Netherlands, or for software engineers wanting to move here.</description>

      <description>Hello {every,no-}one, Writing the first entry for every blog is much more difficult than I first thought (having to rewrite this first sentence for the tenth time proves this to me). With an audience consisting of literally just one person, yourself, it&amp;rsquo;s a bit like shouting into the void. Whilst it can clear your head, allowing you to put your thoughts in order, the notice of nobody hearing what you said makes it a bit sad.</description>
